    "## Method 2: Single-Shot SOS Program\n",
    "With the previous formulation we had to solve a sequence of SOS programs, now we consider an equivalent formulation of the SOS problem in which we can directly maximize $\\rho$.\n",
    "In the previous case we wrote a SOS program to check the implication\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x} \\in L(\\rho) \\Rightarrow \\dot{V}(\\mathbf{x}) < 0.$$\n",
    "This, however, can be equivalently stated as\n",
    "$$\\dot{V}(\\mathbf{x}) \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow \\mathbf{x} \\not\\in L(\\rho).$$\n",
    "Expressing $\\mathbf{x} \\not\\in L(\\rho)$ as $V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho \\geq 0$, it turns out that the latter condition can be verified with a single SOS program.\n",
    "(Actually, we should say $V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho > 0$, but working with a computer there is no difference.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The new problem reads as follows.\n",
    "Find an SOS polynomial $\\lambda(\\mathbf{x})$ such that\n",
    "$$V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho - \\lambda(\\mathbf{x}) \\dot{V}(\\mathbf{x}) \\ \\text{is SOS}.$$\n",
    "In fact, this implies $V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho \\geq \\lambda(\\mathbf{x}) \\dot{V}(\\mathbf{x})$ and, for all $\\mathbf{x}$ where $\\dot{V}(\\mathbf{x}) \\geq 0$, we get $V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho \\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that now $\\lambda$ does not multiply $\\rho$, and we can search over both of them at the same time.\n",
    "Hence we can ask the optimizer to maximize $\\rho$.\n",
    "There is however an issue with the current problem formulation...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not quite there yet...\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you see anything wrong with the problem formulation we put together so far? What do you think the maximum $\\rho$ will be?\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated so far, the problem will always return $\\rho = 0$!\n",
    "To see why, first notice that for $\\rho = \\lambda = 0$ the SOS condition above would become $V(\\mathbf{x})$ is SOS, which holds since $V(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^T P \\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "Now consider a positive $\\rho$.\n",
    "Since $V(0) = \\dot{V} (0) = 0$, evaluating the SOS condition in the origin, we would get $-\\rho \\geq 0$ which can never hold!\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everything is lost, we have a neat fix for you.\n",
    "Certainly, if $V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho$ is nonnegative, so is $\\mathbf{x}^T\\mathbf{x}(V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho)$.\n",
    "Hence we consider the SOS condition\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x}^T\\mathbf{x}(V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho) - \\lambda(\\mathbf{x}) \\dot{V}(\\mathbf{x}) \\ \\text{is SOS},$$\n",
    "with $\\lambda(\\mathbf{x})$ SOS.\n",
    "Now the issue in the origin is fixed, since for $\\mathbf{x} = 0$, we get \"$0$ is SOS\", which is always true.\n",
    "Moreover, where $\\mathbf{x}$ is such that $\\dot{V}(\\mathbf{x}) \\geq 0$, the new SOS condition requires $\\mathbf{x}^T\\mathbf{x}(V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho) \\geq 0$ and hence $V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho \\geq 0$ as desired.\n",

    "Now we are good to go!"

    "## Method 3: Smarter Single-Shot SOS Program\n",
    "The SOS program we just wrote was already a satisfying solution, but it turns out we can do even better!\n",
    "From the textbook chapter \"[Lyapunov analysis with convex optimization](https://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/lyapunov.html#optimization)\", you know that every SOS constraint brings with it a lot of optimization variables and an SDP constraint.\n",
    "So, whenever we can, removing redundant SOS requirements is always a good thing to do.\n",

    "(This because $V(\\mathbf{x})$ is a Lyapunov function for the linearized system hence, locally, it works also for the nonlinear system.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the latter observation, instead of asking that $\\dot{V}(\\mathbf{x})$ is negative for all $\\mathbf{x} \\neq 0$ in $L(\\rho)$, we can equivalently ask that all the points $\\mathbf{x} \\neq 0$ where $\\dot{V}(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$ must be outside the level set $L(\\rho)$.\n",

    "but this time we do not require $\\lambda(\\mathbf{x})$ to be SOS.\n",
    "\n",

    "First, notice that this condition implies $\\mathbf{x}^T\\mathbf{x}(V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho) \\geq \\lambda(\\mathbf{x}) \\dot{V}(\\mathbf{x})$.\n",
    "Then, observe that for all $\\mathbf{x}$ such that $\\dot{V}(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$, we get $\\mathbf{x}^T\\mathbf{x}(V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho) \\geq 0$.\n",
    "This implies $V(\\mathbf{x}) - \\rho \\geq 0$, i.e., $\\mathbf{x} \\not\\in L(\\rho)$ as desired.\n",

    "More advanced techniques to approximate ROAs are available.\n",

    "The level set $\\rho$ is generally kept fixed (e.g. equal to unity) since, when reshaping the Lyapunov function, the optimizer is allowed to scale the range of this function arbitrarily.\n",
