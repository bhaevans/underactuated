<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 17"><h1>System Identification</h1>

  <p>My primary focus in these notes has been to build algorithms that design
  of analyze a control system <i>given a model</i> of the plant.  In fact, we
  have in some places gone to great lengths to understand the structure in our
  models (the structure of the manipulator equations in particular) and tried
  to write algorithms which exploit that structure.</p>

  <p>Our ambitions for our robots have grown over recent years to where it
  makes sense to question this assumption.  If we want to program a robot to
  fold laundry, spread peanut butter on toast, or make a salad, then we should
  absolutely not assume that we are simply given a model (and the ability to
  estimate the state of that model).  This has led many researchers to focus on
  the "model-free" approaches to optimal control that are popular in
  reinforcement learning.  But I worry that the purely model-free approach is
  "throwing the baby out with the bathwater".  We have fantastic tools for
  making long-term decisions given a model; the model-free approaches are
  correspondingly much much weaker.</p>

  <p>So in this chapter I would like to cover the problem of learning a model.
  This is far from a new problem.  The field of "system identification" is as
  old as controls itself, but new results from machine learning have added
  significantly to our algorithms and our analyses, especially in the
  high-dimensional and finite-sample regimes.  But well before the recent
  machine learning boom, system identification as a field had a very strong
  foundation with thorough statistical understanding of the basic algorithms,
  at least in the asymptotic regime (the limit where the amount of data goes to
  infinity).  Machine learning theory has brought a wealth of new results in
  the online optimization and finite-sample regimes. My goal for this chapter
  is to establish these foundations, and to provide some pointers so that you
  can learn more about this rich topic.</p>

  <section><h1>Problem formulation</h1>
    
    <subsection><h1>Equation error vs simulation error</h1>

    <figure><img width="80%"" src="data/sysid.svg"/></figure>

    <p>Our problem formulation inevitably begins with the data.  In practice,
    if we have access to a physical system, instrumented using digital
    electronics, then we have a system in which we can apply input commands,
    $\bu_n$, at some discrete rate, and measure the outputs, $\by_n$ of the
    system at some discrete rate.  We normally assume these rates our fixed,
    and often attempt to fit a state-space model of the form \begin{equation}
    \bx[n+1] = f_\balpha(\bx[n], \bu[n]), \qquad \by[n] =
    g_\balpha(\bx[n],\bu[n]), \label{eq:ss_model}\end{equation} where I have
    used $\balpha$ again here to indicate a vector of parameters.  In this
    setting, a natural formulation is to minimize a least-squares estimation
    objective: $$\min_{\alpha,\bx[0]} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \| \by[n] - \by_n
    \|^2_2, \qquad \subjto \, (\ref{eq:ss_model}).$$  I have written purely
    deterministic models to start, but in general we expect both the state
    evolution and the measurements to have randomness.  Sometimes, as I
    have written, we fit a deterministic model to the data and rely on our
    least-squares objective to capture the errors; more generally we will look
    at fitting stochastic models to the data.</p>

    <p>We often separate the identification procedure into two parts, in which
    we first estimate the state $\hat{\bx}_n$ given the input-output data
    $\bu_n, \by_n$, and then focus on estimating the state-evolution dynamics
    in a second step.  The dynamics estimation algorithms fall into two main
    categories: <ul><li><i>Equation error</i> minimizes only the one-step
    prediction error: $$\min_{\alpha} \sum_{n=0}^{N-2} \| f_\balpha(\hat\bx_n,
    \bu_n) - \hat{\bx}_{n+1} \|^2_2.$$  </li><li><i>Simulation error</i>
    captures the long-term prediction error: $$\min_{\alpha} \sum_{n=1}^{N-1}
    \| \bx[n] - \hat{\bx}_n \|^2_2, \qquad \subjto \quad \bx[n+1] =
    f_\balpha(\bx[n], \bu_n),\, \bx[0] = \hat\bx_0,$$ </li></ul>  The
    equation-error formulations often result in much more tractable
    optimization problems, but unfortunately we will see that optimizing the
    one-step error can still result in arbitrarily large simulation errors.
    Therefore, we generally consider the simulation error to be the true
    objective we hope to optimize, and the equation error only as a potentially
    useful surrogate.</p>

    <p>Within this framework of model learning, we will face all of the
    standard questions from supervised learning about sample efficiency and
    generalization.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Preprocessing your data</h1>

      <p>Many of the techniques below can benefit from some basic data
      preprocessing techniques.  The <a
      href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/ident/ug/ways-to-prepare-data-for-system-identification.html">MATLAB
      System Identification Toolbox documentation</a> has some useful advice
      (with emphasis on the fitting of linear models).  </p>
    </subsection>
    -->

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Online optimization</h1>
    
      <p>Theoretical machine learning has brought a number of fresh
      perspectives to this old problem of system identification. Perhaps most
      relevant is the perspective of online optimization
      <elib>Rakhlin14+Hazan16+Rakhlin22</elib>. In addition to changing the
      formulation to considering streaming online data (as opposed to offline,
      batch analysis), this field has (re)popularized the notion of an old idea
      from decision theory: using <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret_(decision_theory)"><i>regret</i></a>
      as the loss function for identification.</p>

      <p>In the regret formulation, we acknowledge that the class of
      parameterized models that we are searching over can likely not perfectly
      represent the input-output data. Rather than score ourselves directly on
      the prediction error, we can score ourselves relative to the predictions
      that would be made by best parameters in our model class. For
      equation-error formulations, the regret $R$ at step $N$ would take the
      form $$R[N] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-2} \| f_\balpha(\hat\bx_n, \bu_n) -
      \hat{\bx}_{n+1} \|^2_2 - \min_{\alpha^*} \sum_{n=0}^{N-2} \|
      f_{\alpha^*}(\hat\bx_n, \bu_n) - \hat{\bx}_{n+1} \|^2_2.$$ The goal is to
      produce an online learning algorithm to select $\alpha$ at each step in
      order to drive the regret to zero. This turns out to be an important
      distinction, as we will see below.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Learning models for control</h1>
    
      <p>So far we've described the problem purely as capturing
      the input-output behavior of the system. If our goal is to use this model
      for control, then that might not be quite the right objective for a
      number of reasons.</p>
      
      <p>First of, predicting the observations might be <i>more</i> than we
      need for making optimal decisions; <elib>Zhang20a</elib> tells that story
      nicely. Imagine you are trying to swing-up and balance a cart-pole
      system, where the only sensor is a camera. The background images are
      irrelevant; we know that only the state of the cart-pole should matter.
      If there was a movie playing on a screen in the background, you don't
      want to spend all of the representational power of your model predicting
      the next frame of the movie, at the cost of not predicting as well the
      next state of the cart-pole.  These challenges have led to a nice active
      area of research on learning <i>task-relevant</i> models/representations;
      I'll devote a section to it below after we cover the basics.</p>

      <p>There are other considerations, as well. To be useful for control,
      we'll need the state of our model to be observable (from online
      observations) and controllable. There may also be trade-offs in model
      complexity. If we learn a just linear model of the dynamics then we have
      very powerful control design tools available, but we might not capture
      the rich dynamics of the world. If we learn too complex of a model, then
      our online planning and control techniques might become a bottleneck.
      <elib>Watter15</elib> makes that point nicely. At the time of this
      writing, I think it's broadly fair to say that deep learning models are
      able to describe incredibly rich dynamics, but that our control tools for
      making decisions with these models are still painfully weak.</p>

  <section id="lumped"><h1>Parameter Identification for Mechanical Systems</h1>

    <p>My primary focus throughout these notes is on (underactuated) mechanical
    systems, but when it comes to identification there is an important
    distinction to make.  For some mechanical systems we know the structure of
    the model, including number of state variables and the topology of the
    kinematic tree.  Legged robots like Spot or Atlas are good examples here --
    the dynamics are certainly nontrivial, but the general form of the
    equations are known.  In this case, the task of identification is really
    the task of estimating the parameters in a structured model.  That is the
    subject of this section.</p>

    <p>The examples of folding laundry or making a salad fall into a different
    category.  In those examples, I might not even know a priori the number of
    state variables needed to provide a reasonable description of the behavior.
    That will force a more general examination of the the identification
    problem, which we will explore in the remaining sections.</p>

    <p>Let's start with the problem of identifying a canonical underactuated
    mechanical system, like an Acrobot, Cart-Pole or Quadrotor, where we know
    the structure of the equations, but just need to fit the parameters.  We
    will further assume that we have the ability to directly observe all of the
    state variables, albeit with noisy measurements (e.g. from joint sensors
    and/or inertial measurement units).  The stronger <a
    href="state_estimation.html">state estimation algorithms</a> that we
    will discuss soon assume a model, so we typically do not use them directly
    here.</p>

    <p>Consider taking a minute to review the <a
    href="multibody.html#double_pendulum">example of deriving the manipulator
    equations for the double pendulum</a> before we continue.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Kinematic parameters and calibration</h1>

      <p>We can separate the parameters in the multibody equations again into
      kinematic parameters and dynamic parameters.  The kinematic parameters,
      like link lengths, describe the coordinate transformation from one joint
      to another joint in the kinematic tree.  It is certainly possible to
      write an optimization procedure to calibrate these parameters; you can
      find a fairly thorough discussion in e.g. Chapter 11 of
      <elib>Khalil04</elib>. But I guess I'm generally of the opinion that if
      you don't have accurate estimates of your link lengths, then you should
      probably invest in a tape measure before you invest in nonlinear
      optimization.</p>

      <p>One notable exception to this is calibration with respect to joint
      offsets.  This one can be a real nuisance in practice.  Joint sensors can
      slip, and some robots even use relative rotary encoders, and rely on
      driving the joint to some known hard joint limit each time the robot is
      powered on in order to obtain the offset.  I've worked on one advanced
      robot that had a quite elaborate and painful kinematic calibration
      procedure which involve fitting additional hardware over the joints to
      ensure they were in a known location and then running a script.  Having a
      an expensive and/or unreliable calibration procedure can put a damper on
      any robotics project.</p>

      <example><h1>Acrobot balancing with calibration error</h1>

        <p>Small kinematic calibration errors can lead to large steady-state
        errors when attempting to stabilize a system like the Acrobot.  I've put together a simple notebook to show the effect here:</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('sysid'))</script>

        <todo>Make a plot of steady-state error as a function of offset error.</todo>

        <p>Our tools from robust / stochastic control are well-suited to
        identifying (and bounding / minimizing) these sensitivities, at least
        for the linearized model we use in LQR.</p>
      </example>

      <p>The general approach to estimating joint offsets from data is to write
      the equations with the joint offset as a parameter, e.g. for the <a
      href="multibody.html#double_pendulum">double pendulum</a> we would write
      the forward kinematics as:  $${\bf p}_1 =l_1\begin{bmatrix} \sin(\theta_1
      + \bar\theta_1) \\ - \cos(\theta_1 + \bar\theta_1) \end{bmatrix},\quad
      {\bf p}_2  =      {\bf p}_1 + l_2\begin{bmatrix} \sin(\theta_1 +
      \bar\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \bar\theta_2) \\ - \cos(\theta_1 + \bar\theta_1
      + \theta_2 + \bar\theta_2) \end{bmatrix}.$$  We try to obtain independent
      measurements of the end-effector position (e.g. from motion capture, from
      perhaps some robot-mounted cameras, or from some mechanical calibration
      rig) with their corresponding joint measurements, to obtain data points
      of the form $ \langle {\bf p}_2, \theta_1, \theta_2 \rangle$. Then we can
      solve a small nonlinear optimization problem to estimate the joint
      offsets to minimize a least-squares residual.</p>

      <p>If independent measurements of the kinematics are not available, it it
      possible to estimate the offsets along with the dynamic parameters, using
      the trigonometric identities, e.g. $s_{\theta + \bar\theta} = s_\theta
      c_\bar\theta + c_\theta s_\bar\theta,$ and then including the
      $s_\bar\theta, c_\bar\theta$ terms (separately) in the "lumped
      parameters" we discuss below.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1 id="inertial">Estimating inertial parameters (and
    friction)</h1>

      <p>Now let's thinking about estimating the inertial parameters of
      multibody system.  We've been writing the manipulation equations in the
      form: \begin{equation}\bM({\bq})\ddot{\bq} + \bC(\bq,\dot{\bq})\dot\bq =
      \btau_g(\bq) + \bB\bu + \text{friction, etc.}\end{equation}  Each of the
      terms in this equation can depend on the parameters $\balpha$ that we're
      trying to estimate.  But the parameters enter the multibody equations in
      a particular structured way: <i>the <b>inverse</b> dynamics equations are
      affine in the inertial parameters</i> <elib>Atkeson86</elib>. Notably,
      the forward dynamics (solving for $\ddot{\bq}$) involves a ${\bf
      M}^{-1}(q)$; these dynamics are <i>not</i> affine in the parameters.
      Generic system identification approaches which treat the multibody
      dynamics as $\bx[n+1] = f(\bx[n], \bu[n])$ will not be leveraging this
      convexity directly.</p>

      <p>To proceed with the inverse dynamics formulation, let us first choose
      a parameterization for the inertias. <elib>Wensing17a</elib> shows that
      the natural parameterization of the inertial terms for a particular rigid
      body, $B$, are in terms of the <i>density-weighted moment matrices</i>:
      \begin{gather*} m_B &=& \iiint_{V_B} \rho(\bx)dV \in \Re \\ {\bf h}_B &=&
      \iiint_{V_B} \bx \rho(\bx) dV \in \Re^3 \\ {\bf \Sigma}_B &=&
      \iiint_{V_B} \bx \bx^T \rho(\bx)dV \in S_3, \end{gather*} where $V_B$ is
      the volume of the geometry in body $B$, the integral notation is for the
      3D volume integral, and $S_3$ is the group of 3x3 (real) symmetric
      matrices. $m_B$ is the total mass of the body, ${\bf h}_B$ is simply the
      mass times the position of the center of mass, and ${\bf \Sigma}_B$ is
      closely related to the more standard form of the inertia matrix. With the
      integral using $x$ represented in the body frame, $B$, we can extract
      ${}^B{\bf p}^{B_{com}} = \frac{1}{m}{\bf h}_B$ and ${\bf I}^{B/Bo} =
      \tr({\bf \Sigma}_B)\mathbb{I}_{3 \times 3} - {\bf \Sigma}_B.$ Since ${\bf
      \Sigma}_B$ is symmetric, we can summarize all of the inertial parameters
      for body $B$ in 10 real numbers: $$\balpha_B = \begin{bmatrix} m_B, {\bf
      h}_B^T, \mathrm{vec}_{\mathrm{sym}}({\bf \Sigma}_B) \end{bmatrix} \in
      \Re^{10},$$ where $\mathrm{vec}_{\mathrm{sym}}$ takes the 6 upper
      triangular elements of the 3x3 symmetric matrices into a vector.
      Naturally, if we aim to estimate the parameters of many bodies
      simultaneously, we can compose these into a single parameter vector
      $\balpha.$</p>

      <p>Remarkably, the inverse dynamics are affine in these parameters. This
      means that the manipulator equations above can be refactored into the
      form \begin{equation}{\bf W}(\bq_n,\dot{\bq}_n, \ddot{\bq}_n, \bu_n)
      \balpha_B + \bw_0(\bq_n,\dot{\bq}_n, \ddot{\bq}_n, \bu_n) = 0.
      \label{eq:least_squares}\end{equation}  We sometimes refer to the ${\bf
      W}$ which is assembled by vertically stacking these equations evaluated
      at all time samples, $n$, as the "data matrix". Given data trajectories
      of positions, $\bq_n,$ and torque measurements, $\bu_n,$ we can estimate
      $\dot{\bq}_n$ and $\ddot{\bq}_n$ with (acausal) filtering. Then we can
      estimate the parameters using least-squares estimation. As such, we can
      leverage all of the strong results and variants from linear estimation.
      For instance, we can add terms to regularize the estimate (e.g. to stay
      close to an initial guess), and we can write efficient recursive
      estimators for optimal online estimation of the parameters using
      recursive least-squares.  My favorite recursive least-squares algorithm
      uses incremental QR factorization<elib>Kaess08</elib>.</p>
        
      <p>Not all values of $\alpha_B$ describe physically-valid inertias. For
      instance, we know that $m_B$ has to be positive. There are constraints on
      the inertia matrix itself. <elib>Wensing17a</elib> showed that these
      constraints are exactly transcribed as positive-definiteness of the
      "pseudo-inertia": $${\bf J}(\balpha_B) := \begin{bmatrix} {\bf \Sigma}_B
      & {\bf h}_B \\ {\bf h}_B^T & m_B \end{bmatrix} \succ 0.$$ If we know the
      geometry of the body, $B$, that we are estimating, then we can optionally
      write additional convex constraints on these parameters. For instance, we
      know that the center of mass must lie inside the convex hull of the
      geometry: $${}^B{\bf p}^{B_{com}} \in \mathrm{conv}(V_B) \Rightarrow {\bf
      h}_B \in m_B \, \mathrm{conv}(V_B).$$ This non-negative scaling of a
      convex set is still a convex set (known as the "perspective" of the set).
      <elib>Wensing17a</elib> also gives a convex constraint on the
      second-moment matrix based on e.g. the minimum-volume Loewner-John
      ellipsoid containing the known geometry.</p>

      <p>Do these additional constraints matter?  In the limit of infinite
      data, then one might hope that the least-squares estimator would obtain
      the correct values without the constraints. But their are two foils to
      this ideal. First, we often wish to operate in a relatively low-data
      regime. Second, it is important to understand that <i>not all of the
      inertial parameters will be identifiable.</i> For instance, if you
      imagine a robotic arm bolted to a table where the first link is a
      rotation about the $z$ axis. Then no amount of data obtained from this
      robot will given any information about the moments of inertia of the
      first link about the $x$ and $y$ axes. Naively including these parameters
      in the estimation problem could not only lead to poor estimates of the
      unidentifiable parameters, but can even render the physical-validity
      constraints on the inertial parameters vacuous.</p>

      <todo>example of non-identifiable parameters making the physical-validity
      constraints vacuous.</todo>

      <p>There are two general approaches to dealing with the unidentifiable
      parameters. First, we can exclude them from the optimization. There are a
      number of algorithms for symbolically extracting the identifiable
      parameters, but it is more common (and likely just as effective) to
      simply evaluate the null-space of a sufficiently rich data matrix, $W$,
      to find the unidentifiable parameters by using, e.g., $\bR_1\alpha_l$
      from the QR factorization: $${\bf W} = \begin{bmatrix} \bQ_1 & \bQ_2
      \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \bR_1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \Rightarrow
      \quad {\bf W}\balpha_B = \bQ_1 (\bR_1 \balpha_B) = \bQ_1
      \bar{\balpha}_{B},$$ where $\bar{\balpha}_B$ are the identifiable
      parameters. To implement the physical-validity constraints, we would need
      to use estimates of the unidentifiable parameters.  Alternatively, one
      can formulate the optimization directly on the full parameters and add a
      regularization term which (ideally) operates in the nullspace of the
      primary objective to drive the unidentifiable parameters towards a prior
      estimate. <elib>Lee19</elib> gives a thorough treatment of this approach
      and provides a convex formulation of a geometrically consistent
      regularizer, which they call the <i>entropic divergence.</i></p>

      <todo>I sent this note to Pat Wensing: "I feel that there is some
      subtlety in combining the regularizer with the constrained optimization
      formulation. Apologies if you addressed this and I missed it!  The
      intuitive hope for the regularizer is roughly that it's operating in the
      null space of the primary objective to handle the unidentifiable
      parameters.  But having the constraints complicates that story quite a
      bit, I think?  For instance, what's to stop the optimization from making
      the triangle inequalities almost vacuous in the non-identifiable
      parameters by paying only the small cost of the regularization
      term?"</todo>

      <p>The least-squares inverse-dynamics formulation also allows one to
      simultaneously fit a number of other relevant dynamic parameters which
      enter linearly into the equations. These include reflected inertial (as a
      diagonal matrix times $\ddot{\bq}$), joint friction (as a constant torque
      multiplied by the sign of $\dot{\bq}$), and damping (as a linear multiple
      of $\dot{\bq}$).</p>

      <p>Allow me to mention one subtle point about numerical scaling. All of
      the equations in the least-squares inverse-dynamics formulation
      (\ref{eq:least_squares}) have units of torque. But the torques used on
      the base link of a robotic arm might be numerically much larger than the
      torques corresponding to the more distal joints. <elib>Lee19</elib>
      addresses this by solving the unconstrained least-squares problem once,
      then taking the error covariance of this solution into the objective
      function for the constrained least-squares optimization. This serves to
      make the least-squares objective coordinate independent.</p>

      <example><h1>Inertial identification for a Kuka iiwa</h1>
      
      </example>

      <p>Solving the least-squares optimizations described here subject to
      convex (semidefinite) constraints requires solving small semidefinite
      programs. There has been some nice work on parameterizations which lead
      to unconstrained, smooth, but nonconvex, optimization problems which can
      be solved with e.g. gradient descent <elib>Rucker22</elib>. In some
      cases, one can still guarantee that all local minima are global minima.
      But my impression from talking to the authors is that numerics of the
      semidefinite programming formulation can be notable better, and that it
      should be preferred if SDP solvers are available.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Simultaneous kinematic and inertial identification via
    lumped parameters.</h1>

      <p>Although it is highly recommended to separate kinematic an inertial
      estimation, some amount of joint estimation is possible when needed. We
      know that the inverse dynamics are affine in the inertial parameters. But
      it turns out the can also be written as affine in the "lumped
      parameters": nonlinear combinations of inertial and kinematic which do
      not depend on the data. I feel this is best explained with a few simple
      examples.</p>

      <example><h1>Lumped parameters for the simple pendulum</h1>

        <p>The now familiar equations of motion for the simple pendulum are
        $$ml^2 \ddot\theta + b \dot\theta + mgl\sin\theta = \tau.$$  For
        parameter estimation, we will factor this into $$\begin{bmatrix}
        \ddot\theta & \dot\theta & \sin\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
        ml^2 \\ b \\ mgl \end{bmatrix} - \tau = 0.$$  The terms $ml^2$, $b$,
        and $mgl$ together form the "lumped parameters".</p>

      </example>

      <p>It is worth taking a moment to reflect on this factorization.  First
      of all, it does represent a somewhat special statement about the
      multibody equations: the nonlinearities enter only in a particular way.
      For instance, if I had terms in the equations of the form, $\sin(m
      \theta)$, then I would <i>not</i> be able to produce an affine
      decomposition separating $m$ from $\theta$.  Fortunately, that doesn't
      happen in our mechanical systems <elib>Khalil04</elib>.  Again, this
      structure is particular to the <i>inverse dynamics</i>, as we have
      written here.  If you were to write the forward dynamics, multiplying by
      $\bM^{-1}$ in order to solve for $\ddot{\bq}$, then once again you would
      destroy this affine structure.</p>

      <example><h1>Multibody parameters in <drake></drake></h1>

        <p>Very few robotics simulators have any way for you to access the
        parameters of the dynamics.  In Drake, we explicitly declare all of the
        parameters of a multibody system in a separate data structure to make
        them available, and we can leverage Drake's symbolic engine to extract
        and manipulate the equations with respect to those variables.
        </p>

        <p>As a simple example, I've loaded the cart-pole system model from
        URDF, created a symbolic version of the <code>MultibodyPlant</code>,
        and populated the <code>Context</code> with symbolic variables for the
        quantities of interest.  Then I can evaluate the (inverse) dynamics in
        order to obtain my equations.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('sysid'))</script>

        <p>The output looks like: <pre><code>Symbolic dynamics:
(0.10000000000000001 * v(0) - u(0) + (pow(v(1), 2) * mp * l * sin(q(1))) + (vd(0) * mc) + (vd(0) * mp) - (vd(1) * mp * l * cos(q(1))))
(0.10000000000000001 * v(1) - (vd(0) * mp * l * cos(q(1))) + (vd(1) * mp * pow(l, 2)) + 9.8100000000000005 * (mp * l * sin(q(1))))
        </code></pre></p>

        <p>Go ahead and compare these with the <a
        href="acrobot.html#cart_pole">cart-pole equations</a> that we derived
        by hand.</p>

        <p>Drake offers a method <a
        href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/namespacedrake_1_1symbolic.html#ae8c85e424b3109ed84a5bb309238bc3c"><code>DecomposeLumpedParameters</code></a>
        that will take this expression and factor it into the affine expression
        above.  For this cart-pole example, it extracts the lumped parameters
        $[ m_c + m_p, m_p l, m_p l^2 ].$</p>

      </example>

      <p>The existence of the lumped-parameter decomposition reveals that the
      <i>equation error</i> for lumped-parameter estimation, with the error
      taken in the torque coordinates, can again be solved using least squares.
      Importantly, because we have reduced this to a least-squares problem, we
      can also understand when it will <i>not</i> work.  Once again, not all of
      the lumped-parameters are identifiable, so we will typically need a
      second step to operate on the identifiable lumped parameters or to add a
      regularization term.</p>

      <example><h1>Parameter estimation for the Cart-Pole</h1>

        <p>Having extracted the lumped parameters from the URDF file above, we
        can now take this to fruition.  I've kept the example simple: I've
        simulated the cart-pole for a few seconds running just simple sine wave
        trajectories at the input, then constructed the data matrix and
        performed the least squares fit.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('sysid'))</script>

        <p>The output looks like this: <pre><code>Estimated Lumped Parameters:
(mc + mp).  URDF: 11.0,  Estimated: 10.905425349337081
(mp * l).  URDF: 0.5,  Estimated: 0.5945797067753813
(mp * pow(l, 2)).  URDF: 0.25,  Estimated: 0.302915745122919</code></pre>
          Note that we could have easily made the fit more accurate with more
          data (or more carefully selected data).</p>

      </example>

      <p>Should we be happy with only estimating the (identifiable) lumped
      parameters?  Isn't it the true original parameters that we are after? The
      linear algebra decomposition of the data matrix (assuming we apply it to
      a sufficiently rich set of data), is actually revealing something
      fundamental for us about our system dynamics. Rather than feel
      disappointed that we cannot accurately estimate some of the parameters,
      we should embrace that <i>we don't need to estimate those parameters</i>
      for any of the dynamic reasoning we will do about our equations
      (simulation, verification, control design, etc).  The identifiable lumped
      parameters are precisely the subset of the lumped parameters that we
      need.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Identification using energy instead of inverse
    dynamics.</h1>

      <p>In addition to leveraging tools from linear algebra, there are a
      number of other refinements to the basic recipe that leverage our
      understanding of mechanics.  One important example is the "energy
      formulations" of parameter estimation <elib>Gautier97</elib>.</p>

      <p>We have already observed that evaluating the equation error in torque
      space (inverse dynamics) is likely better than evaluating it in state
      space space (forward dynamics), because we can factorized the inverse
      dynamics.  But this property is not exclusive to inverse dynamics.  The
      total energy of the system (kinetic + potential) is also affine in the
      lumped parameters.  We can use the relation
      $$\dot{E}(\bq,\dot\bq,\ddot\bq) = \dot\bq^T (\bB\bu + \text{ friction,
      ...}).$$</p>

      <p>Why might we prefer to work in energy coordinates rather than torque?
      The differences are apparent in the detailed numerics.  In the torque
      formulation, we find ourselves using $\ddot\bq$ directly. Conventional
      wisdom holds that joint sensors can reliably report joint positions and
      velocities, but that joint accelerations, often obtained by numerically
      differentiating <i>twice</i>, tend to be much more noisy. In some cases,
      it might be numerically better to apply finite differences to the total
      energy of the system rather than to the individual joints
      <sup>&dagger;</sup>.
      <sidenote><sup>&dagger;</sup> Sometimes these methods are written as the
      numerical integration of the power input, rather than the differentiation
      of the total energy, but the numerics should be no different.</sidenote>
      <elib>Gautier96</elib> provides a study of various filtering formulations
      which leads to a recommendation in <elib>Gautier97</elib>
      that the energy formulation tends to be numerically superior. This
      distinction is probably more important in online parameter estimation,
      where the filters must be causal, as opposed to offline parameter
      estimation where acausal filters can be used.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Residual physics models with linear function
    approximators</h1>

      <p>The term "residual physics" has become quite popular recently (e.g.
      <elib>Zeng20</elib>) as people are looking for ways to combine the
      modeling power of deep neural networks with our best tools from
      mechanics.  But actually this idea is quite old, and there is a natural
      class of residual models that fit very nicely into our least-squares
      lumped-parameter estimation.  Specifically, we can consider models of the
      form: \begin{equation}\bM({\bq})\ddot{\bq} + \bC(\bq,\dot{\bq})\dot\bq =
      \btau_g(\bq) + \balpha_r {\bPhi}(\bq,\dot\bq) + \bB\bu + \text{friction,
      etc.},\end{equation} with $\balpha_r$ the additional parameters of the
      residual and $\bPhi$ a set of (fixed) nonlinear basis functions.  The
      hope is that these residual models can capture any "slop terms" in the
      dynamics that are predictable, but which we did not include in our
      original parametric model.  Nonlinear friction and aerodynamic drag are
      commonly cited examples.</p>

      <p>Common choices for these basis functions, $\bPhi(\bq,\dot\bq)$,
      for use with the manipulator equations include radial basis
      functions<elib>Sanner91</elib> or wavelets
      <elib>Sanner98</elib>.  Although allowing the basis functions to depend
      on $\ddot\bq$ or $\bu$ would be fine for the parameter estimation, we
      tend to restrict them to $\bq$ and $\dot\bq$ to maintain some of the
      other nice properties of the manipulator equations (e.g.
      control-affine).</p>

      <p>Due to the maturity of least-squares estimation, it is also possible
      to use least-squares to effectively determine a subset of basis functions
      that effectively describe the dynamics of your system.  For example, in
      <elib>Hoburg09a</elib>, we applied least-squares to  a wide range of
      physically-inspired basis functions in order to make a better ODE
      approximation of the post-stall aerodynamics during perching, and
      ultimately discarded all but the small number of basis functions that
      best described the data.  Nowadays, we could apply algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">LASSO</a>
      for least-squares regression with an $\ell_1$-regularization, or
      <elib>Brunton16a</elib> uses an alternative based on
       sequential thresholded least-squares.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection id="mbp_experiment_design"><h1>Experiment design as a trajectory optimization</h1>

      <p>One key assumption for any claims about our parameter estimation
      algorithms recovering the true identifiable lumped parameters is that the
      data set was sufficiently rich; that the trajectories were
      "parametrically exciting".  Basically we need to assume that the
      trajectories produced motion so that the data matrix, ${\bf W}$ contains
      information about all of the identifiable lumped parameters.  Thanks to
      our linear parameterization, we can evaluate this via numerical linear
      algebra on ${\bf W}$.
      </p>

      <p>Moreover, if we have an opportunity to change the trajectories that
      the robot executes when collecting the data for parameter estimation,
      then we can design trajectories which try to maximally excite the
      parameters, and produce a numerically-well conditioned least squares
      problem.  One natural choice is to minimize the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number">condition
      number</a> of the data matrix, ${\bf W}$.  The condition number of a
      matrix is the ratio of the largest to smallest singular values
      $\frac{\sigma_{max}({\bf W})}{\sigma_{min}({\bf W})}$.  The condition
      number is always greater than one, by definition, and the lower the value
      the better the condition.  The condition number of the data matrix is a
      nonlinear function of the data taken over the entire trajectory, but it
      can still be optimized in a nonlinear trajectory optimization
      (<elib>Khalil04</elib>, &sect; 12.3.4).</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Online estimation and adaptive control</h1>

      <p>The field of adaptive control is a huge and rich literature; many
      books have been written on the topic (e.g <elib>Åström13</elib>).  Allow
      me to make a few quick references to that literature here.</p>

      <p>I have mostly discussed parameter estimation so far as an offline
      procedure, but one important approach to adaptive control is to perform
      online estimation of the parameters as the controller executes.  Since
      our estimation objective can be linear in the (lumped) parameters, this
      often amounts to the recursive least-squares estimation.  To properly
      analyze a system like this, we can think of the system as having an
      augmented state space, $\bar\bx = \begin{bmatrix} \bx \\ \balpha
      \end{bmatrix},$ and study the closed-loop dynamics of the state and
      parameter evolution jointly.  Some of the strongest results in adaptive
      control for robotic manipulators are confined to fully-actuated
      manipulators, but for instance <elib>Moore14</elib> gives a nice example
      of analyzing an adaptive controller for underactuated systems using many
      of the tools that we have been developing in these notes.</p>

      <p>As I said, adaptive control is a rich subject.  One of the biggest
      lessons from that field, however, is that one may not need to achieve
      convergence to the true (lumped) parameters in order to achieve a task.
      Many of the classic results in adaptive control make guarantees about
      task execution but explicitly do <i>not</i> require/guarantee convergence
      in the parameters.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Identification with contact</h1>

      <p>Can we apply these same techniques to e.g. walking robots that are
      making and breaking contact with the environment?</p>

      <p>There is certainly a version of this problem that works immediately:
      if we know the contact Jacobians and have measurements of the contact
      forces, then we can add these terms directly into the manipulator
      equations and continued with the least-squares estimation of the lumped
      parameters, even including frictional parameters.</p>

      <p>One can also study cases where the contact forces are not measured
      directly.  For instance, <elib>Fazeli17a</elib> studies the extreme case
      of identifiability of the inertial parameters of a passive object with
      and without explicit contact force measurements.</p>

  <section id="linear"><h1>Identifying (time-domain) linear dynamical systems</h1>

    <p>If multibody parameter estimation forms the first relevant pillar of
    established work in system identification, then identification of linear
    systems forms the second.  Linear models have been a primary focus of
    system identification research since the field was established, and have
    witnessed a resurgence in popularity during just the last few years as new
    results from machine learning have contributed new bounds and convergence
    results, especially in the finite-sample regime (e.g.
    <elib>Hardt16+Hazan18+Oymak19+Simchowitz19</elib>).</p>

    <p>A significant portion of the linear system identification literature
    (e.g. <elib>Ljung99</elib>) is focused on identifying linear models in the
    frequency domain.  Indeed, transfer-function realizations provide important
    insights and avoid some of the foibles that we'll need to address with
    state-space realizations.  However, I will focus my attention in this
    chapter on time-domain descriptions of linear dynamical systems; some of
    the lessons here are easier to generalize to nonlinear dynamics (plus we
    unfortunately haven't built the foundations for the frequency domain
    techniques yet in these notes). </p>

    <subsection><h1>From state observations</h1>

      <p>Let's start our treatment with the easy case: fitting a linear model
      from direct (potentially noisy) measurements of the state.  Fitting a
      discrete-time model, $\bx[n+1] = \bA\bx[n] + \bB\bu[n] + \bw[n]$, to
      sampled data $(\bu_n,\bx_n = \bx[n]+\bv[n])$ using the
      <i>equation-error</i> objective is just another <i>linear</i>
      least-squares problem.  Typically, we form some data matrices and write
      our least-squares problem as: \begin{gather*} {\bf X}' \approx
      \begin{bmatrix} \bA & \bB \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} {\bf X} \\ {\bf
      U} \end{bmatrix}, \qquad \text{where} \\ {\bf X} = \begin{bmatrix} \mid &
      \mid & & \mid \\ \bx_0 & \bx_1 &  \cdots & \bx_{N-2} \\ \mid & \mid & &
      \mid \end{bmatrix}, \quad {\bf X}' = \begin{bmatrix} \mid & \mid & & \mid
      \\ \bx_1 & \bx_2 & \cdots & \bx_{N-1} \\ \mid & \mid & & \mid
      \end{bmatrix}, \quad {\bf U} = \begin{bmatrix} \mid & \mid & & \mid \\
      \bu_0 & \bu_1 & \cdots & \bu_{N-2} \\ \mid & \mid & & \mid
      \end{bmatrix}.\end{gather*}  By the virtues of linear least squares, this
      estimator is unbiased with respect to the uncorrelated process and/or
      measurement noise, $\bw[n]$ and $\bv[n]$.</p>

      <example><h1>Cart-pole balancing with an identified model</h1>

        <p>I've provide a notebook demonstrating what a practical application
        of linear identification might look like for the cart-pole system, in a
        series of steps.  First, I've designed an LQR balancing controller, but
        using the <i>wrong</i> parameters for the cart-pole (I changed the
        masses, etc).  This LQR controller is enough to keep the cart-pole from
        falling down, but it doesn't converge nicely to the upright.  I wanted
        to ask the question, can I use data generated from this experiment to
        identify a better linear model around the fixed-point, and improve my
        LQR controller?</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the simple answer is "no".  If you only collect the
        input and state data from running this controller, you will see that
        the least-squares problem that we formulate above is rank-deficient.
        The estimated $\bA$ and $\bB$ matrices, denoted $\hat{\bA}$ and
        $\hat{\bB}$ describe the data, but do not reveal the true
        linearization.  And if you design a controller based on these
        estimates, you will be disappointed!</p>

        <todo>insert some plots?</todo>

        <p>Fortunately, we could have seen this problem by checking the rank of
        the least-squares solution.  Generating more examples won't fix this
        problem.  Instead, to generate a richer dataset, I've added a small
        additional signal to the input: $u(t) = \pi_{lqr}(\bx(t)) + 0.1\sin(t).$
        That makes all of the difference.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('sysid'))</script>

        <p>I hope you try the code. The basic algorithm for estimation is
        disarmingly simple, but there are a lot of details to get right to
        actually make it work.</p>

        <example><h1>The Hydrodynamic Cart-Pole</h1>

          <p>One of my favorite examples of model-based ILC was a series of
          experiments in which we explored the dynamics of a "hydrodynamic
          cart-pole" system.  Think of it as a cross between the classic
          cart-pole system and a fighter jet (perhaps a little closer to the
          cartpole)!</p>

          <p>Here we've replaced the pole with an airfoil (hydrofoil), turned
          the entire system on its side, and dropped it into a water tunnel.
          Rather than swing-up and balance the pole against gravity, the task
          is to balance the foil in its unstable configuration against the
          hydrodynamic forces.  These forces are the result of unsteady
          fluid-body interactions; unlike the classic cart-pole system, this
          time we do not have an tractable parameterized ODE model for the
          system. It's a perfect problem for system identification and ILC.</p>

            <figcaption>A cartoon of the hydronamic cart-pole system.  The cart
            is actuated horizontally, the foil pivots around a passive joint,
            and the fluid is flowing in the direction of the arrows.  (The
            entire system is horizontal, so there is no effect from gravity.)
            The aerodynamic center of the airfoil is somewhere in the middle of
            the foil; because the pin joint is at the tail, the passive system
            will "weather vane" to the stable "downward" equilibrium (left).
            Balancing corresponds to stabilizing the unstable "upward"
            equilibrium (right).  The fluid-body dynamics during the transition
            (center) are unsteady and very nonlinear.</figcaption>

          </figure>

          <p>In a series of experiments, first we attempted to stabilize the
          system using an LQR controller derived with an approximate model
          (using <a href="trajopt.html#perching">flat-plate theory</a>).  This
          controller didn't perform well, but was just good enough to collect
          relevant data in the vicinity of the unstable fixed point.  Then we
          fit a linear model, recomputed the LQR controller using the model,
          and got notably better performance.</p>

          <p>To investigate more aggressive maneuvers we considered making a
          rapid step change in the desired position of the cart (like a fighter
          jet rapidly changing altitude).  Using only the time-invariant LQR
          balancing controller with a shifted set point, we naturally observed
          a very slow step-response.  Using trajectory optimization on the
          time-invariant linear model used in balancing, we could do much
          better.  But we achieved considerably better performance by
          iteratively fitting a time-varying linear model in the neighborhood
          of this trajectory and performing model-based ILC.</p>

        <elib part="Section 7.2">Brunton19</elib> using the so-called "Dynamic
        Mode Decomposition" (DMD).  There have been many empirical success
        stories of using a small number of dominant modes to produce an
        excellent fit to the data (this is especially relevant in problems like
        fluid dynamics where the state vector $\bx$ might be an entire image
        corresponding to a fluid flow).  In DMD, we would write the linear
        dynamics in the coordinates of these eigenmodes (which can always be

      <subsubsection><h1>Linear dynamics in a nonlinear basis</h1>

        <p>A potentially useful generalization  that we can consider here is
        identifying dynamics that evolve linearly in a coordinate system
        defined by some (potentially high-dimensional) basis vectors
        $\phi(\bx).$  In particular, we might consider dynamics of the form
        $\dot\bphi = \pd{\bphi}{\bx} \dot\bx = \bA \bphi(x).$  Much ado has
        been made of this particular form, due to the connection to Koopman
        operator theory that we will discuss briefly below.  For our purposes,
        we also need a control input, so might consider a form like $\dot\bphi
        = \bA \bphi(x) + \bB \bu.$</p>

    <subsection><h1>From input-output data (the state-realization problem)</h1>

      <p>In the more general form, we would like to estimate a model of the
      form \begin{gather*} \bx[n+1] = \bA \bx[n] + \bB \bu[n] + \bw[n]\\ \by[n]
      = \bC \bx[n] + {\bf D} \bu[n] + \bv[n]. \end{gather*}  Once again, we
      will apply least-squares estimation, but combine this with the famous
      "Ho-Kalman" algorithm (also known as the "Eigen System Realization" (ERA)
      algorithm) <elib>Ho66</elib>.  My favorite presentation of this algorithm
      is <elib>Oymak19</elib>.</p>

      <todo>cite VanOverschee96?</todo>

      <p>First, observe that \begin{align*} \by[0] =& \bC\bx[0] + {\bf D}\bu[0]
      + \bv[0], \\ \by[1] =& \bC(\bA\bx[0] + \bB\bu[0] + \bw[0]) + {\bf
      D}\bu[1] + \bv[1], \\ \by[n] =& \bC\bA^n\bx[0] + {\bf D}\bu[n] + \bv[n] +
      \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\bC\bA^{n-k-1}(\bB\bu[k] + \bw[k]). \end{align*} For the
      purposes of identification, let's write $\by[n]$ as a function of the most
      recent $N+1$ inputs (for $k \ge N$): \begin{align*}\by[n] =&
      \begin{bmatrix} \bC\bA^{N-1}\bB & \bC\bA^{N-2}\bB & \cdots & \bC\bB &
      {\bf D}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \bu[n-N] \\ \bu[n-N+1] \\ \vdots \\
      \bu[n] \end{bmatrix} + {\bf \delta}[n] \\ =& {\bf G}[n]\bar\bu[n] + {\bf
      \delta}[n] \end{align*} where ${\bf \delta}[n]$ captures the remaining
      terms from initial conditions, noise and control inputs before the
      (sliding) window. ${\bf G}[n] = \begin{bmatrix} \bC\bA^{N-1}\bB &
      \bC\bA^{N-2}\bB & \cdots & \bC\bB & {\bf D}\end{bmatrix},$ and
      $\bar\bu[n]$ represents the concatenated $\bu[n]$'s from time $n-N$ up to
      $n$.  Importantly we have that ${\bf \delta}[n]$ is uncorrelated with
      $\bar\bu[n]$: $\forall k > n$ we have $E\left[\bu_k {\bf \delta}_n
      \right] = 0.$ This is sometimes known as Neyman orthogonality, and it
      implies that we can estimate ${\bf G}$ using simple least-squares
      $\hat{\bf G} = \argmin_{\bf G} \sum_{n \ge N} \| \by_n - {\bf G}\bar\bu_n
      \|^2.$
      <elib>Oymak19</elib> gives bounds on the norm of the estimation error as
      a function of the number of samples and the variance of the noise.</p>

      <p>How should we pick the window size $N$?  By Neyman orthogonality, we
      know that our estimates will be unbiased for any choice of $N \ge 0$. But
      if we choose $N$ too small, then the term $\delta[n]$ will be large,
      leading to a potentially large variance in our estimate.  For stable
      systems, the $\delta$ terms will get smaller as we increase $N$.  In
      practice, we choose $N$ based on the characteristic settling time in the
      data (roughly until the impulse response becomes sufficiently small).</p>

      <p>If you've studied linear systems, ${\bf G}$ will look familiar; it is
      precisely this (multi-input, multi-output) matrix impulse response, also
      known as the "Markov parameters".  In fact, estimating $\hat{\bf
      G}$ may even be sufficient for control design, as it is closely-related to
      the parameterization used in disturbance-based feedback for
      partially-observable systems
      <elib>Sadraddini20+Simchowitz20</elib>.  But the Ho-Kalman algorithm can
      be used to extract good estimates $\hat\bA, \hat\bB, \hat\bC, \hat{\bf
      D}$ with state-dimension $\dim(\bx) = n_x$ from $\hat{\bf G},$  assuming
      that the true system is observable and controllable with order at least
      $n_x$ and the data matrices we form below are sufficiently
      rich<elib>Oymak19</elib>.</p>

      <p>It is important to realize that many system matrices, $\bA, \bB, \bC,$
      can describe the same input-output data.  In particular, for any
      invertible matrix (aka <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_similarity">similarity
      transform</a>), ${\bf T}$, the system matrices $\bA, \bB, \bC$ and $\bA',
      \bB', \bC'$ with, $$\bA' =  {\bf T}^{-1} \bA {\bf T},\quad \bB' = {\bf
      T}^{-1} \bB,\quad \bC' = \bC{\bf T},$$ describe the same input-output
      behavior.  The Ho-Kalman algorithm returns a <i>balanced realization</i>.
      A balanced realization is one in which we have effectively applied a
      similarity transform, ${\bf T},$ which makes the controllability and
      observability Grammians equal and diagonal<elib part="Ch.
      9">Brunton19</elib> and which orders the states in terms of diminishing
      effect on the input/output behavior. This ordering is relevant for
      determining the system order and for model reduction.</p>

      <p>Note that $\hat{\bf D}$ is the last block in $\hat{\bf G}$ so is
      extracted trivially. The Ho-Kalman algorithm tells us how to extract
      $\hat\bA, \hat\bB, \hat\bC$, with another application of the SVD on
      suitably constructed data matrices (see e.g. <elib
      part="&sect;5.1">Oymak19</elib>, <elib part="&sect;10.5">Juang01</elib>,
      or <elib part="&sect;9.3">Brunton19</elib>).</p>

      <todo>Does using the Kalman filter states allow me to use colored input excitation?</todo>

      <example><h1>Ho-Kalman identification of the cart-pole from keypoints</h1>

        <p>Let's repeat the cart-pole example.  But this time, instead of
        getting observations of the joint position and velocities directly, we
        will consider the problem of identifying the dynamics from a camera
        rendering the scene, but let us proceed thoughtfully.</p>

        <p>The output of a standard camera is an RGB image, consisting of 3 x
        width x height real values.  We could certainly columnate these into a
        vector and use this as the outputs/observations, $y(t)$.  But I don't
        recommend it.  This "pixel-space" is not a nice space.  For example,
        you could easily find a pixel that has the color of the cart in one
        frame, but after an incremental change in the position of the cart, now
        (discontinuously) takes on the color of the background.  Deep learning
        has given us fantastic new tools for transforming raw RGB images into
        better "feature spaces", that will be robust enough to deploy on real
        systems but can make our modeling efforts much more tractable.  My
        group has made heavy use of "keypoint networks" <elib>Manuelli19</elib>
        and self-supervised "dense correspondences"
        <elib>Florence18a+Florence20+Manuelli20a</elib> to convert RGB outputs
        into a more consumable form.</p>

        <figure>
          <iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="data/cartpole_balancing_keypoints.html" height="300" width="100%"></iframe>
        </figure>

        <p>The existence of these tools makes it reasonable to assume that we
        have observations representing the 2D positions of some number of "key
        points" that are rigidly fixed to the cart and to the pole.  The
        location of any keypoint $K$ on a pole, for instance, is given by the <a
        href="acrobot.html#cart_pole">cart-pole kinematics</a>: $${}^{W}{\bf
        p}^{K} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
        {}^{P}{\bf p}^{K},$$ where $x$ is the position of the cart, and
        $\theta$ is the angle of the pole.  I've used <a
        href="http://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/pick.html#monogram">Monogram
        notation</a> to denote that ${}^{P}{\bf p}^{K}$ is the Cartesian
        position of a point $A$ in the pole's frame, $P$, and ${}^{W}{\bf
        p}^{K}$ is that same position in the camera/world frame, $W$.  While it
        is probably unreasonable to linearize the RGB outputs as a function of
        the cart-pole positions, $x$ and $\theta$, it <i>is</i> reasonable to
        approximate the keypoint positions by linearizing this equation for
        small angles.</p>

        <p>You'll see in the example that we recover the impulse response quite
        nicely.</p>

        <figure><img width="70%"
        src="data/keypoint_impulse_response.svg"></figure>

        <p>The big question is: does Ho-Kalman discover the 4-dimensional
        state vector that we know and like for the cart-pole?  Does it find
        something different?  We would typically choose the order by looking at
        the magnitude of the singular values of the Hankel data matrix.  In
        this example, in the case of no noise, you see clearly that 2 states
        describe most of the behavior, and we have diminishing returns after 4 or 5:</p>

      so-called "AutoRegressive models with eXogenous input (ARX)" models. The
      coefficients of ARX models can be fit directly from input-output data
      using linear least squares.</p>

      <p>While it is certainly possible to think of these models as state-space
      models, where we collect the finite history $\by$ and $\bu$ (except not
      $\bu[n]$) into our state vector.  But this is not necessarily a very
      efficient representation; the Ho-Kalman algorithm might be able to find a
      much smaller state representation.  This is particularly important for

  <section><h1>Identification of finite (PO)MDPs</h1>

    <p>There is one more case that we can understand well: when states,
    actions, and observations (and time) are all discrete.  Recall that in the
    very beginnings of our discussion about optimal control and <a
    href="dp.html">dynamic programming</a>, we used graph search and
    discretization of the state space to give a particularly nice version of
    the value iteration algorithm.  In general, we can write the
    <i>stochastic</i> dynamics using conditional probabilities: $$\Pr(s[n+1] |
    s[n], a[n]), \qquad \Pr(o[n] | s[n], a[n]),$$ where I've (again) used $s$
    for discrete states, $a$ for discrete actions, and $o$ for discrete
    observations. With everything discrete, these conditional probabilities are
    represented naturally with matrices/tensors.  We'll use the tensors
    $T_{ijk} \equiv \Pr(s[n+1] = s_i | s[n] = s_j, a[n] = a_k)$ to denote the
    transition matrix, and $O_{ijk} \equiv \Pr(o[n] = o_i | s[n] = s_j, a[n] =
    a_k)$ for the observation matrix.</p>

    <todo>Introduce the transition matrix better in the DP chapter, and make
    the notation consistent (in the DP section, I have T transposed).</todo>

    <subsection><h1>From state observations</h1>

      <p>Following analogously to our discussion on linear dynamical systems,
      the first case to understand is when we have direct access to state and
      action trajectories: $s[\cdot], a[\cdot]$.  This corresponds to
      identifying a Markov chain or Markov decision process (MDP).  The
      transition matrices can be extracted directly from the statistics of the
      transitions: $$T_{ijk} = \frac{\text{number of transitions to }
      s_i\text{ from }s_j, a_k}{\text{total number of transitions from }s_j,
      a_k}.$$ Not surprisingly, for this estimate to converge to the true
      transition probabilities asymptotically, we need the identification
      (exploration) dynamics to be <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodicity">ergodic</a> (for every
      state/action pair to be visited infinitely often).</p>  <todo>there must
      be some finite-sample results to reference here, too.</todo>

      <p>For large MDPs, analogous to the modal decomposition that we described
      for linear dynamical systems, we can also consider factored
      representations of the transition matrix. [Coming soon...]</p>

  <section><h1>Neural network models</h1>

    <p>If multibody parameter estimation, linear system identification, and
    finite state systems are the first pillars of system identification, then
    (at least these days) deep learning is perhaps the last major pillar.  It's
    no coincidence that I've put this section just after the section on linear
    dynamical systems.  Neural networks are powerful tools, but they can be a
    bit harder to think about carefully.  Thankfully, we'll see that many of
    the basic lessons and insights from linear dynamical systems still apply
    here. In particular, we can follow the same progression: learning the
    dynamics function directly from state observations, learning state-space
    models from input-output data (with recurrent networks), and learning
    input-output (autoregressive) models with feedforward networks using a
    history of outputs.</p>

    <p>Deep learning tools allow us to quite reliably tune the neural networks
    to fit our training data.  The major challenges are with respect to data
    efficiency/generalization, and with respect to actually designing planners
    / controllers based on these models that have such complex
    descriptions.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Generating training data</h1>

      <p>One extremely interesting question that arises when fitting rich
      nonlinear models like neural networks is the question of how to generate
      the training data.  You might have the general sense that we would like
      data that provides some amount of "coverage" of the state space; this is
      particularly challenging for underactuated systems since we have dynamic
      constraints restricting our trajectories in state space.</p>

      <p>For multibody parameter estimation <a href="#mbp_experiment_design">we
      discussed</a> using the condition number of the data matrix as an
      explicit objective for experiment design.  This was a luxury of using
      <i>linear</i> least-squares optimization for the regression and it takes
      advantage of the specialized knowledge we have from the manipulator
      equations about the model structure.  Unfortunately, we don't have an
      analogous concept in the more general case of nonlinear least squares
      with general function approximators.  This approach also works for
      identifying linear dynamical systems.  The challenge is here perhaps
      considered less severe since for linear models in the noise-free case
      even data generated from the impulse response is sufficient for
      identification.</p>

      <p>This topic has received considerable attention lately in the context
      of <i>model-based reinforcement learning</i> (e.g.
      <elib>Agarwal20b</elib>).  Broadly speaking, in the ideal case we would
      like the training data we use for system identification to match the
      distribution of data that we will encounter when executing the optimal
      policy.  But one cannot know this distribution until we've designed our
      controller, which (in our current discussion) requires us to have a
      model.  It is a classic "chicken and the egg" problem.  In most cases, it
      speaks to the importance to interleaving system identification and
      control design instead of the simpler notion of performing identification
      once and then using the model forevermore.</p>

  <section><h1>Task-relevant models</h1>
  
  <p>As discussed briefly in the introduction, the standard objective for
  system identification is to match the input-output behavior of a dynamical
  system. Certainly if we can find a model that predicts all outputs perfectly,
  then this model should be sufficient for making optimal decisions. But when
  we cannot make perfect predictions, due to limited data and/or limited model
  representation power, then the relative cost placed on predicting different
  outputs becomes important. This feels particularly important when the
  observations come from a camera -- in most cases predicting every pixel in
  the scene accurately is not the right objective for a robot trying to use the
  camera to accomplish a particular task.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the problem of learning task-relevant models or "learning
  state representations" has become a darling of the machine learning
  community. There are a lot of smart people thinking about the problem and the
  field has made considerable progress in the last years. In the immense volume
  of papers, I think there are a few really core ideas.</p>

  <p>What makes a good state representation for control? Two defining
  properties are: 1) it should be observable, and 2) it should be sufficient
  for making optimal decisions. In other words, if $\bz[n]$ is the state of the
  dynamic controller (which we can think of as an observer of the learned state
  representation), then we would like that the optimal policy given this state
  to take the same action as an optimal policy which uses the entire available
  history: $$\pi^*(\bz[n]) \approx \bar\pi^*(\by[n], \by[n-1], \by[n-2], ...,
  \bu[n-1], \bu[n-2], ...).$$ Certainly the <i><a href="belief.html">belief
  state</a></i>, which is by definition a sufficient statistic for predicting
  future observations, has this property. But much more minimal representations
  may also be sufficient. So a third, slightly more tenuous property of a good
  state representation is that we would like it to be tractable for learning,
  representation, and decision making.</p>

  <p>Being sufficient for making optimal control decisions is a difficult
  objective because it couples the problem of representation learning / system
  identification with the problem of control design. How can we know what the
  optimal action is without solving the optimal control problem? This is one
  reason that imitation learning <elib>Florence20+Florence22</elib> is a
  potentially valuable undertaking -- by providing demonstrations of an
  "optimal" policy, it reduces representation learning back to classical system
  identification and allows us to focus on the question of state representation
  without simultaneously solving control design. Other works like
  <elib>Srinivas18</elib> attempt use a planner on the learned representation
  even during learning, and take a loss function requesting that the actions
  taken from a policy using the current state matches the actions taken from a
  planner using the representation to optimize multiple steps into the
  future.</p>

  <p>A closely related idea would ask for the representation to be sufficient
  to predict the optimal value function (rather than the optimal action).
  Certainly if we have a model and a value function that is consistent with
  that model, then this would be sufficient for making optimal decisions. But
  it should be noted that there are cases where predicting the optimal
  cost-to-go is actually harder than predicting the optimal action. Imagine an
  agent in a grid world that can traverse one of two corridors and has learned
  that the left corridor always has more reward than the right. Predicting the
  precise amount of reward that will be obtained when moving down the left
  corridor is not needed to choose the optimal action. Predicting optimal
  values also does not break the "chicken-and-the-egg" problem (how can you
  know the optimal values until you have an optimal policy?), but may have more
  subtle merits in terms of representation or learning efficiency.</p>

  <p>One proposal which <i>does</i> fundamentally break the chicken-and-the-egg
  problem is given by <elib>Subramanian19</elib> and called "approximate
  information states" (AIS). The key idea in this work is that if a state
  representation, $\bz[n]$ is 1) sufficient to predict the one-step reward, and
  2) sufficient to predict $\bz[n+1]$, then it is sufficient for making optimal
  decisions. This motivates their notion of an <i>approximate</i> information
  state, as a representation that approximately accomplishes these two goals.
  They provide one particular bound for the suboptimality of the resulting
  policy, based on worst case errors in the one-step reward and next state
  predictions. In my group, we've been studying this approach, trying to
  understand the implications for the two cases we can deeply understand:
  finite (tabular) Markov decision processes <elib>Yang22</elib> and
  linear-Gaussian systems <elib>Tian22</elib>. In particular,
  <elib>Yang22</elib> gives an algorithm for solving the AIS conditions to
  optimality for a class of POMDPs; it provides evidence that representations
  which are optimal by the AIS metric are not necessarily optimal for
  reproducing the optimal actions, and that the AIS bounds on performance can
  be very loose.</p>

  <p>Approximate information states are themselves closely related to prior
  work on "state aggregation" in MDPs via the so-called "bisimulation metrics".
  The basic idea is that if the future outcomes from two states are
  indistinguishable, then these states can be aggregated into a single state,
  thus reducing the state space. See <elib>Givan03</elib> for the original work
  on exact bisimulation, <elib>Ferns04</elib> for approximate bisimulation, 
  <elib>Castro09</elib> for an extension to POMDPs, and <elib>Zhang20a</elib>
  for a more modern version using neural networks.</p>

  <p>Interestingly, the famous work by DeepMind on MuZero
  <elib>Schrittwieser20</elib> learns a task-relevant state representation
  using a combination of all of these ideas: the loss function for the state
  combines a loss for predicting the action, the value function, and the
  one-step reward. But I have seen a few projects that struggled to reproduce
  its success in robotics domains.</p>

  <p>This area is moving fast; I will try to update this section as results
  appear, and will give some worked out examples soon.</p>

  <section><h1>Exercises</h1>

    <exercise id="linear_sysid"><h1>Linear System Identification with different objective functions</h1>

      <p>Consider a discrete-time linear system of the form
        $$x[n+1] = Ax[n]+Bu[n]$$
        where $x[n]\in\mathbf{R}^p$ and $u[n]\in\mathbf{R}^q$ are state and control at step $n$.
        The system matrix $A\in\mathbf{R}^{p\times p}$ and $B\in\mathbf{R}^{p\times q}$ are unknown parameters of the model, and your task is to identify the parameters given a simulated trajectory. Using the trajectory simulation provided in <script>document.write(notebook_link('sysid', 'linear_sysid', link_text = 'this python notebook'))</script>, implement the solution for the following problems.</p>

      <ol type="a">

        <li>Identify the model parameters by solving $$\min_{A, B}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\lVert x[n+1] - Ax[n] -Bu[n] \rVert_2^2.$$</li>

        <li>Identify the model parameters by solving $$\min_{A, B}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\lVert x[n+1] - Ax[n] -Bu[n] \rVert_{\infty}.$$</li>

        <li>Identify the model parameters by solving $$\min_{A, B}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\lVert x[n+1] - Ax[n] -Bu[n] \rVert_1.$$</li>
      </ol>

    </exercise>

    <exercise id="glider_sysid"><h1>System Identification for the Perching Glider</h1>

      <p>In this exercise we will use physically-inspired basis functions to fit the nonlinear dynamics of a perching glider.   <script>document.write(notebook_link('sysid', 'glider_sysid', link_text = 'In this python notebook'))</script>, you will need to implement least-squares fitting and find the best set of basis functions that describe the dynamics of the glider.  Take the time to go through the notebook and understand the code in it, and then answer the following questions.  The written question will also be listed in the notebook for your convenience.</p>

      <ol type="a">

        <li>Work through the coding sections in the notebook.</li>

        <li>All of the basis configurations we tested used at most 3 basis functions to compute a single acceleration. If we increase the number of basis functions used to compute a single acceleration to 4, the least-squares residual goes down. Why would we limit ourselves to 3 basis functions if by using more we can generate a better fit?</li>
